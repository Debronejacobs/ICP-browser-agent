## ü§ñ What is AIbrowser? The Power of an Agent Team

AIbrowser isn't just a chatbot that answers questions; it's a **fully autonomous multi-agent system** that lives in your browser. It gives a team of specialized AI agents direct control over a web browser to accomplish complex tasks on your behalf.

### How the AI Agent Team Works

When you give AIbrowser a goal, a collaborative process begins:

1.  üß† **The Planner (The Strategist):** This agent analyzes your high-level goal and breaks it down into a concrete, step-by-step plan. For example, "find top speakers" becomes "1. Navigate to Amazon. 2. Search for 'Bluetooth speakers'. 3. Filter by 'water-resistant'. 4. Extract results."

2.  üñ±Ô∏è **The Navigator (The Operator):** This agent executes the plan. It's the one that actually clicks buttons, types into search bars, scrolls pages, and extracts data from the web page's content.

3.  ‚úÖ **The Validator (The Quality Analyst):** After each step, this agent reviews the Navigator's work. Did it successfully navigate to the right page? Did it extract the correct information? If not, it provides feedback so the team can self-correct and try again.

This continuous loop of **Plan -> Execute -> Validate** allows AIbrowser to tackle dynamic and complex workflows that a simple script could not.

## ‚ú® Why Supercharge Agents with the Internet Computer (ICP)?

While powerful, standard browser agents have a major limitation: they are stateless and forgetful. Close the browser, and their memory is gone. This fork (`Debronejacobs/ICP-browser-agent`) solves this by integrating with ICP, giving your agent team:

-   **üîê A Secure, Persistent Memory:** Conversation history, agent preferences, and task results are stored securely on the decentralized Internet Computer, not just your local machine. Your agents remember you and your past interactions across sessions and devices.
-   **üë§ A Sovereign Identity:** Instead of relying on traditional logins, we are implementing Internet Identity. You own and control your access, ensuring a private and secure user experience.
-   **üöÄ Unstoppable & Resilient Backend:** By leveraging ICP's decentralized architecture, the "backend" for your agents is robust, tamper-proof, and always available, free from single points of failure.
-   **üí∏ 100% Free & Open:** AIbrowser remains completely free. You bring your own LLM keys, and the ICP integration provides a powerful, privacy-preserving alternative to costly cloud services.

## üî• Key Features

-   üß† **Autonomous Multi-Agent System:** A team of Planner, Navigator, and Validator agents collaborate to achieve your goals.
-   üí¨ **Interactive Side Panel:** Command your agents and see their real-time progress through an intuitive chat interface.
-   üîÑ **Contextual Follow-up:** Ask follow-up questions and refine tasks; the agents remember the context.
-   üîå **Flexible LLM Support:** Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Ollama, and other providers. You can even assign different models to different agents for optimal performance and cost!
-   **[‚ú® ICP Enhanced] Persistent, Decentralized History:** Securely store and access your full conversation history on the Internet Computer.
-   **[‚ú® ICP Enhanced] Decentralized Configuration:** Your agent settings and API keys can be stored securely on-chain.
-   **[‚ú® ICP Planned] Secure & Sovereign Login:** Authenticate using Internet Identity for a passwordless, privacy-first experience.

## üí° See The Agent Team In Action

These examples showcase the kind of complex tasks the agentic system can handle:

> "Go to GitHub's trending page for Python. Find the top 3 repositories. For each one, visit its page, find its primary license, and tell me how many stars it has. Compile the results in a table."

> "I need a recipe for vegan lasagna. Search for a highly-rated one on Google, navigate to the recipe page, and extract the full list of ingredients and the step-by-step instructions."

> "Research the new 'Claude 3.7 Sonnet' model. Go to the official Anthropic blog, find the announcement post, and summarize the key improvements over the previous model in three bullet points."
