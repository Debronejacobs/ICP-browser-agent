</div>

**Note:** This is a fork of the original [Nanobrowser](https://github.com/nanobrowser/nanobrowser) project, maintained at `https://github.com/Debronejacobs/ICP-browser-agent`. This version is being adapted to integrate with the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** for decentralized data storage and secure login, aiming to enhance robustness and data privacy.

## üåê Nanobrowser with ICP Integration

Nanobrowser is an open-source AI web automation tool that runs in your browser. This fork extends its capabilities by integrating with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for decentralized data storage (e.g., conversation history, user preferences) and secure login mechanisms. We aim to provide a free, privacy-centric alternative to tools like OpenAI Operator, with flexible LLM options, a multi-agent system, and the added benefits of ICP's decentralized infrastructure.

‚¨áÔ∏è For the original Nanobrowser experience, you can get it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nanobrowser/imbddededgmcgfhfpcjmijokokekbkal).
**This ICP-enhanced fork requires manual installation (see "Manually Install Latest Version" or "Build from Source" below).**

## ü§ñ Choosing Your Models

Nanobrowser allows you to configure different LLM models for each agent to balance performance and cost. This remains unchanged in this fork. Here are recommended configurations from the original project:

### Better Performance
- **Planner & Validator**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Navigator**: Claude 3.5 Haiku

### Cost-Effective Configuration
- **Planner & Validator**: Claude Haiku or GPT-4o
- **Navigator**: Gemini 2.0 Flash or GPT-4o-mini

### Local Models
- **Setup Options**: Use Ollama or other custom OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **Recommended Models**: Qwen3 14B, Falcon3 10B, Qwen 2.5 Coder 14B, Mistral Small 24B.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Local models require more specific prompts.

> **Note**: The cost-effective configuration may produce less stable outputs.
> **Tip**: Experiment and share your model configurations!

## üí° See It In Action (Base Nanobrowser Functionality)

These examples showcase the power of the core Nanobrowser agent system:

1.  **News Summary**:
    > "Go to TechCrunch and extract top 10 headlines from the last 24 hours"

2.  **GitHub Research**:
    > "Look for the trending Python repositories on GitHub with most stars"

3.  **Shopping Research**:
    > "Find a portable Bluetooth speaker on Amazon with a water-resistant design, under $50. It should have a minimum battery life of 10 hours"

*The ICP integration will primarily affect how data from these interactions is stored and how users are authenticated, rather than changing these core commands.*
